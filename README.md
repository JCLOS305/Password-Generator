# JavaScript: Password Generator Created by Jeancarlos Mulet w/  ðŸ™Œ The University of Miami ðŸ™Œ

**Version 1.0.0** 

## Description 
For this challenge I was instructed to create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. 
The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. 
It has a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, which ensures that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.



## Acceptance Criteria


- GIVEN I need a new, secure password
- WHEN I click the button to generate a password
- THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
- WHEN prompted for password criteria
- THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
- WHEN prompted for the length of the password
- THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
- WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
- THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
- WHEN I answer each prompt
- THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
- WHEN all prompts are answered
- THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
- WHEN the password is generated
- THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
